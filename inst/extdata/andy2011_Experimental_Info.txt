MS/MS Tolerance: +/- 0.2 Da
Instrument: ESI-ORBITRAP-HCD

Percolator Parameters:

Percolator Version Used: None. Percolator was misbehaving when this data was processed so Mascot E-values were used to benchmark ID significance rather than PEPs. Any E-values less than 0.05 were accepted for quantitation. The E-value is less stringent than PEP but my general impression is this has made little difference to the overall quality of data.

Additional filtering was applied to the data after percolating to refine protein inference within iSPY. Swissprot accessions were given precedence over trEMBL accessions, and isoforms from the same UniProt accession were collapsed together. These assumptions substantially reduce the redundancy of the database, allowing more "unique" peptides to be taken forward for quantitation.

iSPY Parameters:

Analysis Module: ReporterIons.pm
Protein Inference Module: PEDL.pm
Results Output Format: FullTSV.pm
Posterior Error Probability Threshold: 0.05
Maximum Parent Proteins: 1
Precursor Ion Width: 0.06
Precursor Ion Calculation: Trapezoid
Precursor Selection Width: 0.5
Precursor Selection Calculation: Trapezoid
Tag List: 113.107,114.111,115.108,116.111,117.115,118.111,119.115,120.081,121.122
(Note that 120.081 is the phenylalanine immonium ion and not an iTRAQ reporter ion. It was included as a benchmark for identification)
Tag Area Calculation: SUM
Tag Ion Width: 0.03

Post-Processing:

Unquantifiable spectra (E-value for PSM > 0.05, non-unique sequences, very low ion counts, >2 zero value reporter ions ) removed
Spectra filtered based on several criteria (precursor relative signal, position of switch relative to peak apex, reporter ion intensity) to pick a single "peptidotypic" spectrum per peptide
Peptides were merged into proteins by intensity weighted mean
AutoGO is a high-throughput extraction of organelle specific GO terms from the UniProt database. Some proteins have annotation relating to multiple organelles.
QuickAnnotation is used to quickly annotate plots with the existing information.
